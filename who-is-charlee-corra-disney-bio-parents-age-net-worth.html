Although it might sound incorrect to use a plural pronoun for a singular person, we use “they” because of its gender neutrality.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Charlee, they first came out privately as transgender in 2018. And it was only 4 years later, that they dared to come out to the world at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Human Rights Campaign</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At the time, Charlee even announced that their family would be donating $250 thousand to the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, just a month before that, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Walt Disney Co</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. was under fire for donating every sponsor and co-sponsor of the Parental Rights in Education bill but not condemning the bill itself.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Charlee Corra Disney Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Charlee Corra Disney was born to parents Roy P. and Sheri Disney.

Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education Act, “especially because our child, Charlee, is transgender and a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Sheri mentioned that the matching donation was meant to remind people that LGBTQ children need support.“I have a trans kid, and I love my kid no matter what,” she added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking more about Charlee’s father, Roy P.
