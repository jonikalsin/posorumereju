From there, her career has seen only an upward growth, often making her personal life subject to scrutiny. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in March 2020, Palmer said she prefers to date someone not from the "same career." "I've always had the same philosophy when it comes to dating. Not that I wouldn't give someone a try. But trying to keep my private life outside of my work life, to me, it's easiest when you don't date someone with the same career," said the 'Hustlers' actress. However, her romantic partners include some high-profile men.</p><h2 class=split>2009: Earl 'Ben J' Benjamin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/680fbb44-c219-4dd4-b086-67154024fbb5.jpg><p>In 2009, Palmer was reportedly in a relationship with rapper Earl Benjamin, better known by his stage name Ben J.

And on November 9, she filed a restraining order against Jackson, which was immediately granted.
