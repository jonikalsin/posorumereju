The mayor there, John Ramon Vigil, took to Facebook to honor Hussain.</p><p>“I am deeply saddened to report that Monday night City of Española Planning and Land Use Director Muhammad Afzaal Hussain was shot and killed in Albuquerque. APD is investigating the shooting, but it appears Muhammad was randomly targeted in a senseless act of violence,” Vigil wrote on Facebook.</p><p>“Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh. He was well respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community. Tuesday would have marked his first-year anniversary leading the City’s planning team.”</p><p>Meanwhile, officials elsewhere have also expressed concern with the killings.</p><p>President Joseph Biden tweeted that he is “angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque.”</p><p>“While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims’ families, and my Administration stands strongly with the Muslim community. These hateful attacks have no place in America,” Biden wrote.</p><p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham wrote in a tweet on Saturday that the slayings appeared to be “targeted.”</p><p>“The targeted killings of Muslim residents of Albuquerque is deeply angering and wholly intolerable,” Grisham wrote in a Twitter post.</p><p>“I am sending additional State Police officers to Albuquerque to work in close coordination with APD and the FBI to bring the killer or killers to justice – and they WILL be found. We will continue to do everything we can to support to the Muslim community of Albuquerque and greater New Mexico during this difficult time.”</p><p>Ahmad Assed, the president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico, said the murders are terrorizing Albuquerque’s Muslim community.</p><p>“Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Assed told CNN. “Businesses are closing . . . early. Students won’t leave their homes.”</p><p>The city is working to provide resources to people who are afraid of coming out of their homes, including delivering meals, KOB4 reports.</p><p>A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the killings. To report information, call Albuquerque Metro Crime Stoppers at 505-843-STOP (7867).</p><p>The Council on American Islamic Relations is also offering a $10,000 reward.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.
