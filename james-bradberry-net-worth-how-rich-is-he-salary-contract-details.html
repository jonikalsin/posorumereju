Earlier this year, the NFL cornerback renewed his contract with the Eagles for another three years.

The Samford graduate began his NFL career with the Carolina Panthers in 2016.</p><p>He was picked in the second round by the Panthers and stayed with the organization until 2019. Bradberry had his greatest season in the NFL last year, appearing in Super Bowl LVII against Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs.&nbsp;Bradberry and 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel had a few words a few weeks ago. Samuel called James “trash” and subsequently stated he didn’t regret it. But the cornerback defused the situation by saying that although he doesn’t necessarily agree with what Samuel said, he won’t engage in a verbal brawl with him.</p><h2>James Bradberry Net Worth: Sponsorship Deals of an NFL Star</h2><p><strong>James Bradberry</strong>, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles, is said to have a $8 million net worth.

They further claimed that the NFL player became a fan of the brand after suffering an injury early in his career.&nbsp;He teamed with Matt Blatt’s Car Dealerships, a Philadelphia-based firm, last year. Bradberry, like many of his athletic buddies, enjoys playing golf in his spare time. He generally posts multiple photos of himself on the golf course.</p><p>Bradberry has previously used his daughter, Xena, in Hoka marketing campaigns. The father-daughter team is also active with the organization. In July, James and his daughter paid a visit to the Simpson House elderly care home.&nbsp;Hundreds of pairs of Hoka shoes were given to locals by him and Xena.
