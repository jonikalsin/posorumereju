Harper, an attorney for Thompson’s family, wrote in a statement shared with The Post Friday that Thompson had been in custody since he was arrested for misdemeanor simple battery in June.&nbsp;</p><p>“Three months later Mr. Thompson was found dead in a filthy jail cell after being eaten alive by insects and bed bugs,” Harper said.</p><p>“When his body was found one of the detention officers refused to administer CPR because in her words she ‘freaked out.’ The jail cell Mr. Thompson was housed in was not fit for a diseased animal. He did not deserve this.”</p><p>Disturbing photographs attached to Harper’s statement show Thompson’s cell, which is covered in dirt and strewn with debris.</p><p>One image also shows Thompson’s bony body with defibrillator pads on his chest, which is covered in what appear to be small insect bites.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">LaShawn Thompson died on Sept. 13, 2022. <span class=credit>Harper Law Firm</span></figure><p>Harper also sent The Post a copy of the Fulton County medical examiner’s report, which lists Thompson’s cause of death as undetermined but notes a “severe bed bug infestation” in his cell.</p><p>Harper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told USA Today</a> this week that Thompson’s relatives are “asking for a criminal investigation into the matter and (major) changes at the jail.”</p><p>Members of Thompson’s family gathered outside the Fulton County courthouse on Thursday to demand justice.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Photos from Thompson’s cell show the disgustingly dirty conditions. <span class=credit>Harper Law Firm</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Thompson’s family is demanding justice for their loved one. <span class=credit>Harper Law Firm</span></figure><p>“It was heartbreaking because nobody should be seen like that. Nobody should see that,” Thompson’s brother, Brandon McCrae, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told WSBTV</a> of the photos of his late brother’s living conditions.</p><p>In a written statement to Channel 2 Action News, the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office said it launched a “full investigation” into Thompson’s death.</p><p>In the wake of the incident, the department immediately dedicated an additional $500,000 to address “bed bugs, lice and other vermin” at the jail, and updated sanitary protocols, the force said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Thompson’s body ravaged by what appear to be small bug bites. <span class=credit>Harper Law Firm</span></figure><p>“The ongoing investigation is examining details regarding the medical care provided and ultimately will determine whether any criminal charges are warranted in this case,” the statement said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mamxfnLKwvsaimGahnqKutbGMnpitnZ5irq211Z5km7Fdl8Kov4yfmKahnK58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
