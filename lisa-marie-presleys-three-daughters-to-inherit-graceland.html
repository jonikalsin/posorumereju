Presley officially received the estate on her 25th birthday — effectively becoming the sole owner of Graceland.</p><p>She was also left with $100 million, which she quickly squandered through a series of ruinous business decisions.</p><p>Elvis purchased Graceland in 1957 for $100,000. The estate has since opened its doors to paying visitors and even offered tours, as well as overnight stays.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">When Elvis died in 1977, Lisa Marie was staying with him at Graceland in Memphis. <span class=credit>Michael Ochs Archives</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Elvis’s gold-appointed living room. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The pool room at the Memphis estate. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Graceland’s dining room. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The lavish estate is now worth an estimated $500 million.</p><p>“The tour of Graceland Mansion includes the living room, his parents’ bedroom, the kitchen, TV room, pool room, the famous Jungle Room, his father’s office, the newly-enhanced Trophy Building, the Racquetball Building — newly-restored to how it looked in 1977, and Meditation Garden,” the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website says</a>.</p><p>The younger Presley, who passed away on Jan. 12 after suffering cardiac arrest, is survived by her twin daughters, Harper and Finely Lockwood, 14, and daughter, Riley Keough, 33. She was 54.</p><p>While the estate’s fate remained up in the air, Presley previously hinted that the home would always be in her family.</p><p>“It is absolutely 100 percent mine, and it has always been mine, Graceland,” she told Entertainment Tonight in 2013. “It will always be. And when it is no longer mine, it will be my children’s.
