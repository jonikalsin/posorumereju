However, she has never been one to conform to societal expectations regarding relationships. Despite her age, she has always been content with being single.</p><p>Her desire to stay single is perhaps influenced by the emotional scars left by her parent’s divorce and her anxiety.

It wasn’t until a Christmas party in December 2019 that they finally succeeded, much to Strong’s surprise and pleasure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Cecily_Strongs_Partner></span>Who Is Cecily Strong’s Partner?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cecily Strong isn’t married, but she does have a boyfriend.
