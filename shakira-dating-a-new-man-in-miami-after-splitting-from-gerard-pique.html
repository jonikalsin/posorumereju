Initially, the poor health of her 91-year-old father William Mubarak was cited as the main reason for her decision to delay her move to Miami at the beginning of the year, after finalizing a child custody agreement with Pique in December.</p><p>The couple, who ended their 11-year relationship in May, confirmed in November that they had reached an agreement after a long negotiation, culminating in a marathon 12-hour meeting with their attorneys. They signed the agreement at a court in Barcelona the following month.</p><p>As part of the agreement, retired footballer Pique, who is now dating Catalan beauty Clara Chia, 23, will have holiday time with their children.</p><p>The South American artist performed her diss track with Argentinian DJ Bizarrap on the Jimmy Fallon Show earlier this month, where she directed critical remarks at Pique and his new partner. She also discussed her separation from the former footballer.</p><p>In a subsequent interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais, Pique expressed being ‘very happy’ after the significant changes in his life, including the split with Shakira and retirement from football.</p><p>He declined to comment on Shakira in the interview but added, ‘Each parent has the responsibility to try to do the best for their children.<br>‘It’s about protecting them. That’s the work of all parents with their children. That’s what I’m focused on and that’s my job as a father.’</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqoZmbnr%2BiecOaq6Kml2KubrrEsGSmmZ5itq95zKKYpqFdlrO1sdFmqqmkmanBqrrGZp2rp51itKa%2BwKubZqiZpsKmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
