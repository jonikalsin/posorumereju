The news of his death has drawn attention towards his surviving family members. Fans wondered about his relationship status. Was he married before his death?</p><p>Delve into this article to find out.</p><h3><strong>Jamal Edwards Cause Of Death: How Did He Die?</strong></h3><p>British rap music artist Jamal Edwards made headlines after his death at the age of 31. The artist’s ‘sudden’ death was confirmed by his mother Brenda Edwards, host of the popular UK daytime show “Loose Women”. His cause of death was a sudden illness but the nature of his illness wasn’t confirmed.</p><p>Brenda released a Twitter statement where she wrote, “It is with the deepest heartache that I confirm that my beautiful son Jamal Edwards passed away yesterday morning after a sudden illness. Myself, his sister Tanisha and the rest of his family and friends are completely devastated. He was the center of our world.”</p><p>Jamal’s mother continued, “As we come to terms with his passing we ask for privacy to grieve this unimaginable loss. I would like to thank everyone for their messages of love and support. Jamal was an inspiration to me and so many. Our love for him lives on, his legacy lives on. Long live Jamal Edwards MBE, MBA, and Ph.D.”</p><p>Singer Rita Ora paid tribute to the artist after his death and wrote in an IG post, “My first ever interview was with you. Jamal, Our endless talks on music and the belief you had in me and so many of us before we even believed in ourselves.’ I’m devastated. No words can describe how grateful I am to of been in your presence. Thank you for all you ever showed me. My heart goes out to @brendaedwardsglobal and the whole family. RIP.”</p><h3><strong>Jamal Edwards Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Jamal Edwards was private about his relationship status most of his life. But, some tweets suggested that he certainly received a lot of advances from women on the internet.</p><p>In May 2014, he appeared cozying up with Anabel Englund (@anabelenglund) but the nature of their relationship couldn’t be confirmed. Jamal had captioned the post, “<span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">Good to see my bae&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@misssingrid</a>“.</span></p><p><span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">In November 2018, he again appeared with Alewya where the latter was affectionately leaning on him. But, they appeared as if they were very close friends and nothing romantic was brewing between the two.</span></p><p>Jamal had also made a hilarious post back in 2014 when he posted a picture of his palm and wrote, “Happy valentines day babe. Been together 23 years. Love you more & more every day. #Forever”.</p><h3><strong>Was Jamal Edwards Ever Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Jamal Edwards wasn’t married at the time of his death. Or at least, his mother didn’t mention him having a wife at the time of his passing. But, in September 2017, he had once attended a family wedding, and he posted pictures from the day on his IG.</p><h3><strong>Jamal Edwards Father</strong></h3><p>Jamal Edwards has only mentioned father once on his Twitter. In June 2012, he tweeted, “My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me. Happy fathers day x”. There is no information on his biological father. But, Jamal’s father was in a brief relationship with his mother when she became pregnant at the age of 20.</p><p>Jamal’s mother Brenda Edwards was married to his step-father Patrick Edwards in 1996. Patrick helped raise Jamal and his sister. He worked as a mortgage broker and came into Brenda’s life when Jamal was only five.</p><p>But, Brenda has also talked about the abusive nature of the relationship back in September 2020 during an emotional interview on Today’s show. She talked about fearing for her life when she was punched in the face and threatened with a knife, two years after she had escaped her abusive boyfriend. She revealed that she would “blame herself” for her partner’s violent and manipulative behavior, but eventually left her boyfriend after he strangled her over a ‘missing apple pie’.</p><p>Brenda hadn’t revealed the abuse to her family because it would make the matter worse. She planned to escape with her best friend. After a brief tussle between her and her friend and Patrick, they got out. Jamal’s mom disappeared for two years and felt she was rebuilding her home until her partner showed up unannounced.</p><h3><strong>Did Jamal Edwards Leave Behind Any Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Jamal Edwards is survived by his sister Tanisha. She is available on Instagram (<a href=#>@tanishadarling</a> and <a href=#>@tanisha.arts_</a>).</p><p>Jamal featured his sister recently on her birthday in November 2019. He captioned, “<span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">Happy birthday to my younger sibling. You may be a year older but you’re still my little sis… Hope you had a lovely day, keep smashing the ish out of the world! x”</span></p><h3><strong>Jamal Edwards Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Jamal Edwards reportedly has a net worth of over £15 million.
