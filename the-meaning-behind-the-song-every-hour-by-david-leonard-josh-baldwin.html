It has the power to lift us up when we are down, to bring us comfort when we are in pain, and to remind us of the love and faithfulness of God. One such song that has resonated deeply with me is “Every Hour” by David Leonard & Josh Baldwin.</p><p>With its powerful yet simple lyrics, “Every Hour” speaks to the unwavering presence of God in our lives. The song starts with the proclamation, “Lord, You know me, and You always will.” These words remind us that God knows us intimately and will always be with us, no matter what we face. He is our constant companion and source of strength.</p><p>The lyrics continue, “Oh, You keep me and You hold me close, like new mercies in the morning still. You surround me and all I know.” These lines paint a beautiful picture of God’s love and care for us. Just like the new mercies we receive from Him every morning, He surrounds us with His presence and protects us from the troubles of the world.</p><p>The chorus of the song repeats the phrase, “Every hour of every day, oh, I need You, Lord, and that will never change.” This is a powerful reminder of our dependence on God. No matter what time of day or season of life we are in, our need for Him remains constant. His love and grace are unchanging and always available to us.</p><p>The second verse of the song emphasizes God’s role as our fortress and hiding place. It declares, “You’re my fortress, you’re my hiding place, you’re the shelter where I am safe.” These words remind us that God is our refuge and protection. In Him, we can find rest and safety from the storms of life.</p><p>The bridge of the song proclaims, “Faithful, that’s who You are, more than able to care for my heart, Father and Friend, there ’til the end.” These lines highlight the faithfulness of God and His ability to take care of us. He is not only our Heavenly Father but also our Friend who will never leave us nor forsake us.</p><p>Personally, this song has been a source of comfort and strength during challenging times in my life. It has reminded me that no matter how difficult things may seem, God is always there for me. When I feel overwhelmed or discouraged, I turn to this song as a reminder of His presence and love.</p><p>There have been moments when I have felt alone and lost, but listening to “Every Hour” has brought me back to a place of peace and security. It has reminded me to lean on God and to trust in His faithfulness. This song has become my anthem of dependence on Him, knowing that He is always near and will never change.</p><p>In conclusion, “Every Hour” by David Leonard & Josh Baldwin is a beautiful song that reminds us of the unchanging love and faithfulness of God in our lives. Its powerful lyrics speak to the depths of our hearts and serve as a reassurance that no matter what we face, God is always with us. This song has touched my life in a profound way and continues to be a source of inspiration and encouragement. I am grateful for the message it carries and the comfort it brings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBqaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmacr52irnqpu9SrZJuxXZmut7XDZqOep56Wv6V5yaiqoWWSlrmlw8inZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
