Baird revealed that Birkhead had indeed fathered Smith’s infant daughter, later named Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern.</p><p>Furthermore, Smith claimed that his lawyer and business partner, Stern, was the father. In 2007, a Bahamian court ordered that custody of Dannielynn be transferred to Birkhead from Stern, who changed her birth certificate to show him as her father and renamed her Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead.</p><p>Smith’s mother, Virgie Arthur, has registered for Dannielynn’s care and attempted to prevent Birkhead from leaving the country with the child.
