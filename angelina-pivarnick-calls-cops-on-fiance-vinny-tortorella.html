After speaking with the officers, Angelina decided not to file charges,” Pivarnick’s attorney, James Leonard Jr., told Page Six in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>“This matter is now closed.

(Seen here with her ex-husband, Chris). <span class=credit>angelinamtv/Instagram</span></figure><p>“My client and Ms. Pivarnick are still engaged and are still residing together. Mr. Tortorella denies any act of impropriety that would warrant police involvement and denies any act of domestic violence occurred,” Rozin-Golinder said in a statement.</p><p>“No charges have been pressed against my client by Ms. Pivarnick or law enforcement. I ask that his privacy be respected in this regard.”</p><p>A source also tells Page Six that the couple is currently filming the MTV reality show’s next season.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“Angelina and Vinny are still engaged and are still very much in love with one another and they are both actively filming Jersey Shore Season 7 that will air in the fall,” our source says. <span class=credit>Tamara Beckwith/NY POST</span></figure><p>“Angelina and Vinny are still engaged and are still very much in love with one another and they are both actively filming ‘Jersey Shore’ Season 7 that will air in the fall,” our source says.</p><p>Tortorella and Pivarnick, 37, <a href=#>became engaged</a> during the latter’s “divorce” party honoring her the <a href=#>finalization of her split</a> from her first husband, Chris Larangeira.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six reality TV updates</strong></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“Mr. Tortorella denies any act of impropriety that would warrant police involvement and denies any act of domestic violence occurred,” the police officer’s attorney told Page Six. <span class=credit>angelinamtv/Instagram</span></figure><p>“I love you so much. A lot of things in life aren’t guaranteed, but something that I’ve learned since I met you is loving you is gonna be guaranteed for the rest of my life,” he told Pivarnick during the filmed proposal while the rest of the cast watched in surprise.</p><p>“If there’s anything beyond life, I want us to love each other, do everything — good, bad, little, big — I’ll always have your back, I know you’ll have my back,” Tortorella continued.</p><p>“I want to grow old with you, I want to experience everything with you.

So, he’s a nice guy, and maybe in a couple years she’ll trade him out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmlvaGhpZK6vs8SloKeZXaW2t63Rp6Cco12Yrq240maaqKijYryvecWimKeblWLDqrrNsmStp6KpvLOxy6WYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
